##Journal: 

where I do all my reflections on the readings/activities 
Getting set up whas a bit challenging. I'd never had to properly code anything prior but it's rewarding now that I know what to do 
I learnt how to create a markdown file and upload it here and now I know that two hashtags next to a word makes it a title as well. 
Notes from listening to Shawn's audio on mortuary archeology: 
1. There is an ethical aspect we should be aware of
2. The recording scheme can work offline

Thinking about races and doing the proper research 
What I learnt from Robin: 
People working in archeology don't exactly have it easy but one they set their mind on a goal they work regardless of the conditions.
Mortuary archeology is essential to understaning our histories and I'm excited to hear more. I've always thought about archeologists especially when I vsion the landscape and truth of what we call our history. How do we know what to trust? How can we preserve this trust for future generations? It takes a lot of acre to make sure that nothing slips through the cracks and there arew no cracks in the artefacts atht didn't manage to slip past.
