## memo

I ran into a challenge when it came to uploading files to the repo. All I had to do was tap on code and tap on the plus beside it to  get drap and drop the files from finder. Then I made a journal and a memo but it was showing the code format even in the preview and then my TA helped me add the .md. 

I'm also trying to work on the alternative assignment. I have taken a screenshot of my graveyeard and know what section I'm going to be doing but I still don't know how I'm going to record it since I'm not in person.
